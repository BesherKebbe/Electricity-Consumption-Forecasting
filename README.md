Project Objective: This project aims to predict the total electricity
consumption of a city for one year.
Project Scope: This project involves forecasting electricity consumption
using data analytics and machine learning techniques.
Project Goals:
The Energy Management Department of Chicago aims to predict the
total electricity consumption for the next year to prevent issues like
sudden consumption spikes in winter and peak air conditioning use in
summer, thereby making energy management more efficient.
Data Used:
• Electricity consumption data (monthly/total)
• Building Characteristics (Building Type, Subtype, Average Number of Floors, Average Building Age,
Average House Size)
• Population Data (Total Population)
• Geographical Location Data (Districts)
Expected Results:
• Develop a model that accurately predicts the total electricity consumption for the next year.
• Identify which factors affect electricity consumption and to what extent.
• Develop efficient strategies for energy planning and infrastructure investments by making accurate
predictions.
